Demand charges will be adjusted for consumers with 20 kW or more of measured demand to correct for average power factors lower than 90% and may be so adjusted for other consumers if and when the seller deems necessary.  Such adjustments will be made by increasing the measured demand 1% for each 1% by which the average power factor is less than 90% lagging.

* The Power Cost Adjustment (PCA) shall be applied to customers in all rate schedules and classes.  The PCA shall be adjusted to the most current billing period, as information is available from the Utilities wholesale provider(s).  The PCA adjustment shall appear on the consumers billing statement following the billing period of the Fuel Cost Factor (FCA) adjustment for wholesale power cost by the wholesale provider(s).

CHARACTER OF SERVICE
The Company will supply service from its electric supply lines at only such frequency, phase,
regulation, and one standard secondary voltage or the available primary voltage in the location where
service is required. (See Company Rule 3 for the Company's standard voltages.)
When the Customer under this schedule elects to take service through separate meters the readings of
such meters will not be combined, but will be computed separately under this schedule for each meter
supplied. When the customer desires combined metering the customer shall provide upon his own
premises and at his own expense the proper insulating transformers, regulators, and other equipment
necessary to split the service. Load shall be balance between phases, if in the judgment of the
company such balancing is necessary.
For Customers utilizing thermal storage, the Customer must arrange the wiring for the thermal
storage equipment to permit the measurement of the demand and energy use of such equipment by
suitable metering equipment as specified by the company. The company shall at all times, have the
right to inspect such metering to insure that such service metered is exclusively thermal storage use.

provided however, that in no case shall the Monthly Demand Charge be less than $228.80.

DETERMINATION OF MAXIMUM DEMAND
Customer's maximum demand in any month shall be determined by maximum demand instruments.
The maximum demand of electric energy supplied in any month shall be taken as the highest average
load in kilowatts occurring during any 30 consecutive minutes of the month; provided, however, that
if such load shall be less than 50% of the maximum momentary demand in kilowatts, then the
maximum demand shall be taken at 50% of such maximum momentary demand. However, for
Customers utilizing thermal storage, the maximum demand shall be limited to the greater of the
actual maximum demand occurring during the On-Peak period or 50% of the maximum demand
