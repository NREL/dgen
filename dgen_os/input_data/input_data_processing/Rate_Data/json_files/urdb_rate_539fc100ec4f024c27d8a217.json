The Company may under unusual circumstances permit more than one set of living quarters to be served through one meter under this rate, but if so, the Customer Charge shall be multiplied by the number of separate living quarters so\nserved. A church and adjacent buildings owned and operated by the church may be served under this rate, but any such buildings separated by public ways must be billed separately.\n\nCustomers who meet the eligibility requirements for being engaged in the business of agriculture or farming as defined in M.G.L. Chapter 128 Section 1a at their service location are eligible for an additional discount from their distribution service rates. The discount will be calculated as 10% of the Customer's total bill for service provided by the Company before application of this discount. Customers who meet the requirements of this section must provide the Company with appropriate documentation of their eligibility under this provision.",
