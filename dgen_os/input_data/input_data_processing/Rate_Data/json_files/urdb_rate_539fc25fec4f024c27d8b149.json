      "description": "Application:\r\n\r\nAt any point on the City's interconnected system where there are facilities of adequate capacity. \r\n\r\nThis schedule is for electric service applications for customers that have alternate renewable electric power generation on the customer side of the meter. This schedule is intended for customers that generate electric energy from renewable sources that they would otherwise purchase from the City utility.\r\n\r\nA customers generating facility used for net metering shall be equipped with metering equipment that can measure the flow of electricity in both directions. The city will install a meter capable of measuring bi-directional energy flow at the customer's expense. The normal cost of a meter will be deducted from the cost of the bi-directional meter. \r\n\r\nThis will normally be accomplished through use of a single bidirectional meter. At the customer's request and expense an additional meter may be installed for the customer's purposes. Other requirements are outlined in the Logan City Light and Power Net Metering Policy.\r\n\r\nThe customer shall adhere to all service and billing requirements including the installation of approved metering equipment as per Logan City Electric Service Requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnergy Rate for Energy Purchased by the Customer: \r\n\r\nThe City shall credit the Customer in kilowatt-hours (kWH) at a ratio of 1:1 for any excess production of their generating facility that exceeds the customer's on-site consumption of kWh in the billing period each month. Excess energy generated by the customer which would otherwise be purchased from the utility will offset energy at the full retail rates up to the amount of energy the customer uses each month.  Excess energy generated beyond the customers use during daytime hours will be purchased by the utility at the rate specified below. Energy generated during the night time, through battery backup systems, will not be purchased under this schedule.\r\n\r\nResidential customers will be charged the current Rate Schedule 1. Commercial customers will be charged under the applicable current Commercial Rate Schedule which they qualify for based on criteria in the electric rate schedules. All of the rate schedules may be changed from time to time.",
