This service is also applicable to separately-metered service to common areas of multi-family accommodations. Customers may also be eligible for service under Schedule A-2 if usage exceeds 8,000 kWh per month. However, only one rate schedule change is allowed every 12 months except by mutual agreement between the Customer and Alameda Municipal Power (AMP).\n\n*When the customer owns all the transformers, and delivery hereunder is made at the same voltage as that of the distribution line from which the service is supplied, a discount of 3% for 11 kV or higher available line voltages and 2% for available line voltages of from 2 kV to 10 kV will be applied to all charges except taxes, provided, however, AMP is not required to supply service at a non-standard voltage.\n\n*Flat Rate Adjustment = Energy Resources Surcharge ($0.00029) + State Solar Photovoltaic Program ($0.00145) = $0.00174",
