This load will be determined on an annual basis each December. Non-residential consumers with load more than 50 KW demand for at least three of the previous twelve months will be subject to review. Consistent variance greater than 10% of 50 KW may cause the consumer to subsequently be placed on the most appropriate rate.\r\n*The base rates listed below are adjusted upward or downward depending on the cost of wholesale power.  This adjustment is known as the Power Cost Recovery Factor (PCRF).  The PCRF is applied to each kWh billed.\r\n\r\n* See also (http://www.wcec.org/files/2613/2613/8705/Tariff_12-19-11.pdf)",
