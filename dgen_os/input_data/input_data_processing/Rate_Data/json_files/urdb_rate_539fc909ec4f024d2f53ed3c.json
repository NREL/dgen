If the customer's net kWh energy flow is negative during the billing period, the negative net kWh generation shall accumulate as a credit to offset kWh energy consumption in subsequent billing periods.  Such excess kWh generation credits, if any, will carry over from month to month, limited to a calendar year.  At the end of each calendar year, cumulative credits, if any, will be refunded by the REMC and the customer's credit reset to zero.",
