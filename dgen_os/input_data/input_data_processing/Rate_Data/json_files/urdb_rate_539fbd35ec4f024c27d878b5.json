When the heating qualification is satisfied, air conditioning loads and heat pump based domestic storage water heater loads (with Efficiency Factor ratings of 2.0 or greater) will be permitted on this rate. \n\nParticipating members must qualify for Rate Schedule A and concurrently take service under that rate. Service is subject to the established rules and regulations of the Cooperative. A Member Service Agreement is required for service under this schedule.\n\nThis rate is subject to the Energy Optimization Surcharge and the Power Supply Cost Recovery clause.",
