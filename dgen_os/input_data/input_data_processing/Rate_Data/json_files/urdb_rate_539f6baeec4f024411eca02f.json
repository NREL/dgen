(Primary Service).\n** Generator must be incidental to the Primary Service, installed on the customer's premises, and used to supply some or all of the customer's loads.\n** Generator capacity shall not be more than 25 kilowatts for a residential facility, or not more than 2 megawatts for a non-residential facility, unless the governing authority approves a greater generation capacity.\n** Generator must have a maximum output of less than 10% of the nearest source side primary voltage protective device, and must be less than 80% of the installed transformer capacity at the Primary Service.\n** Generator must have the same output voltage and phasing as the Primary Service.\n** Generator must be a fuel cell or other renewable energy powered generator controlled by an inverter which has been designed, tested, and UL certified to UL1741 and IEEE1547 standards. \n** Generator must have positive \"anti islanding\" capability per UL1741.\n** Generator must have output voltage with less than 1% Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), current output with less than 2% THD, and be operated with a 1.0 to .95% lagging Power Factor.  Leading power factor operation will not be permitted.\n** Generator must be provided with a \"Visible Disconnect Switch\" per NESC requirements which can be padlocked in the OPEN position and is accessible to Garkane personnel at all times.  Disconnect must be permanently and visibly marked as \"GENERATOR DISCONNECT\" in letter at least 2\" high.\n** The electrical function, operation, or capacity of a customer generation system, at the point of connection to the electrical corporation's distribution system, may not compromise the quality of service to the electrical corporation's other customers.\n** Service under this schedule will require the installation of In/Out Directional Metering prior to the initiation of service.  Customer shall pay for the cost of the Directional Meter.\n\n* Energy metered under this rate shall be the net energy returned to the distribution system during any billing period.\n* MONTHLY BILL: Energy Credit per kWh  $0.024",
