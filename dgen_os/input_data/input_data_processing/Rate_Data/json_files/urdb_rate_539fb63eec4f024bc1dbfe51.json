Motors having a rated capacity in excess of ten (10) horsepower must be three phase unless otherwise approved by the Cooperative. Consumers having their homes on the same premises with their business establishments may include service to both on the same meter, in which case all service will be billed under this schedule, using the current billing rate. If the consumer prefers, he may make a provision for two meters, in which case his usage for residential purposes will be billed under the appropriate residential schedule, and his usage for business purposes will be billed under this schedule. All commercial services will be demand metered if the kva requirement is in excess of 25 kva and/or kilowatt hour usage is more than 2,200 kwh per month. The billing demand shall be the maximum average kilowatt load used for any period of fifteen (15) consecutive minutes during the month for which the bill is rendered as recorded by a demand meter.",
