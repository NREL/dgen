Service under this Schedule will normally be delivered through not more\nthan one single phase or one polyphase demand meter, and the customer's\ndemand will be taken monthly to be the highest registration for a\n15-minute period on that meter.\n2. Where a customer has more than one building or facility on the same site\nor where a single building is allowed more than one service, the monthly\nbilling demand will be taken as the sum of all the separate meters\ninvolved.\n3. This Schedule shall be used to serve apartment houses where the individual\nunits are not separately metered. An apartment shall be defined as a\nbuilding or portion thereof used or designed as a residence for two or\nmore families living independent of each other. Families shall be\nconsidered to be living independently of each other where their respective\nunits have separate ingress and kitchen facilities.\n4. For the purpose of this Schedule, commercial operations are considered to\ninclude hotels, motels and boarding houses with more than five boarders.\n5. This Schedule shall be used to service certain residences where businesses\nare conducted therein as defined in paragraph 4, page A-1 -- Schedule:\nResidential (R.S.) -- where the maximum electrical capacity of equipment\nfor the portion of the residence used for business exceeds 2.5 KW when\nserved by a single meter. If these services are separated, this schedule\nshall be used to service the business portion of such residences.\n6. When the customer owns, operates, and maintains the complete substation\nequipment, including any and all transformers and/or switches and/or other\napparatus necessary for the customer to take his entire service at the\nPrimary voltage of the transmission or distribution line from which said\ncustomer is to receive service; a credit of $0.32 per KW of monthly\nbilling demand will be applied to each monthly bill.\n7. This Schedule shall be used for all temporary service installations.",
