Such adjustments will be made by increasing the measured demand 1% for each 1% of major fraction thereof by which the average power factor is less than 95% lagging.\r\n\r\nMetered real energy measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh) and metered reactive energy measured in Kilovolt Ampere-Hours (kVARh) are used to calculate the average monthly power factors as follows:\r\n\r\n     power factor = kWh / (square root (kWh squared + kVARh squared))",
