In addition, this tariff is available to all commercial grain storage. (Not available to irrigation).\n\nThe measured demand shall be the maximum kilowatt demand established by the Consumer for any consecutive 15 minute period during the month for which the bill is rendered, as indicated or recorded by a demand meter.\n\n\nThe consumer agrees to maintain unity power factor as nearly as practicable. Demand Charges may be adjusted to correct for average power factors lower than 95% if and when the Seller deems necessary. Such adjustments will be made by increasing the measured KW demand 1% for each 1% by which the average power factor is less than 95% lagging.",
