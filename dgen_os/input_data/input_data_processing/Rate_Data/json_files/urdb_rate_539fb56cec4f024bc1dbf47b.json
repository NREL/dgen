Single-phase motors not to exceed 10 horsepower, individual capacity, may be served under this rate. Youth-oriented (18 years of age and younger) non-profit sports leagues utilizing electric service for sports field lighting at municipally owned outdoor facilities may be served under this rate regardless of demand. Meters in which the load exceeds 10 kW of demand in any month will be assigned to Rate 16 (Secondary General Service) and will not be eligible to be reassigned to Rate 10 until there have been 12 consecutive months where loads have not exceeded 10 kW of demand.\r\n\r\n*Subject to power cost adjustment.",
