      "description": "Effective In: All territory served.\nClassification: Commercial, Industrial and Institutional customers.\nAvailability: Available to customers whose actual demand is greater than fifty (50) kW but less than or equal to fourteen hundred (1400) kW. Available for electric service at primary voltage levels, as herein defined, supplied through one (1) metering point, where customer owns, operates and maintains all distribution facilities beyond Company's point of delivery. No resale permitted.\nCharacter of Service: Alternating current, 60 Hertz, at any one standard voltage available for the service required.\nPayment and Late Payment Charge: Bills for electric service are due and payable within fifteen (15) days from date of bill. Any amounts not paid on or before the due date of the bill shall be subject to a late payment charge set forth in the Company's rules and regulations.\nMinimum Charge: The monthly minimum charge shall be the customer charge plus the billing demand charge subject to the special terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.\nEnergy Cost Adjustment: This schedule is subject to the energy cost adjustment.\nTax/Fee Adjustment: This schedule is subject to the tax/fee adjustment.\nAuxiliary Service Rider: This schedule is subject to the auxiliary service rider when applicable.\nDemand Side Management Cost Adjustment: This schedule is subject to the demand side management cost adjustment.\nGeneral Rate Schedule Adjustment: This schedule is subject to the general rate schedule adjustment.\nDetermination of Billing Demand: The billing demand shall be the highest average kilowatt (kW) load measured during the fifteen (15) consecutive minutes of maximum use; or 75% of the highest maximum kW demand in the previous eleven (11) months; or fifty (50) kW, whichever is greatest.\nPower Factor Adjustment: For the purposes of this computation, the reactive power demand shall be the highest average kilovar (kvar) load measured during the fifteen (15) consecutive minutes of maximum use during the billing month; the real power demand (kW) will be the billing demand. When the ratio of the kvar to kW demands thus determined exceeds .33, a power factor correction charge shall be applied. This charge shall be $.43 per kvar for each kvar in excess of 33% of the kW billing demand.\nContract Period: Not less than one (1) year.\nSpecial Terms and Conditions: Service supplied under this schedule is subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Company's rules and regulations, and extension policy on file with the Public Utilities Commission of the State of Colorado. For the purposes of this rate, service voltages of 4.16 kV or greater, but less than 69 kV line-to-line, will be considered primary voltage levels. The point of delivery will be Company's primary metering point. Customer must own, operate and maintain all distribution facilities such as supporting structures, disconnect devices, transformers, fuses and wiring beyond point of delivery. If metering is at other than delivery voltage, the measured demand and energy consumption will be adjusted at the meter to compensate for actual transformer losses.",
