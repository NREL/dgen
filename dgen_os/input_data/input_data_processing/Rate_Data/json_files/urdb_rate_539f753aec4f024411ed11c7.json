Single and three phase service will be metered and billed separately or, where feasible, single and three phase service will be furnished through a single meter installation and billed as one account provided the customer arranges his wiring to facilitate the installation of a single meter. Where service is furnished at three-phase, the customer shall provide and maintain all equipment required for lighting service. Where a transformer installation is utilized solely to furnish service to a single customer, the Company may meter the service on the primary side of the transformers, and in such case the load and energy registrations shall each be reduced 2%. Customers served by the EDC under Rate Schedule GS who choose an EGS must arrange to have all of their power provided by a single EGS. Additionally, all power provided by the EGS to Customers taking service under this rate schedule must follow the load shape of the Customer. If any EGS is providing power that is not following the load shape of the customer, the Customer must pay for any additional metering that is required and approved by the Company in order to ascertain hourly loads (kW) at the conclusion of the billing month and also to measure load (kW) in 15-minute intervals. \nIn addition to the charges provided in this tariff, a surcharge of 0.58% will apply on all bills rendered on and after January 1, 2011 pursuant to Pa. P.U.C. authorization of March 10, 1970.",
