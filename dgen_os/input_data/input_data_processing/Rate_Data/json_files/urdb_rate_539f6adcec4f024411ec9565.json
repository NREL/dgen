(See Company Rule 3 for the Company's standard voltages.)\r\n\r\nMINIMUM CHARGE\r\nThe Customer's Minimum Charge under this rate shall be based on the connected load at each\r\nlocation or on the installation of Fire and Civil Defense warning signals if these are the entire electric\r\nload. The minimum shall be $2.21 per horsepower or fraction thereof per month for the first 25\r\nhorsepower of the connected load, $1.07 per horsepower or fraction thereof per month for the next\r\n475 horsepower of connected load, and $0.54 per horsepower or fraction thereof per month for all\r\nover 500 horsepower of connected load, or $6.99 per month for each warning signal installation\r\nwhere such signals constitute the connected load, provided, however, that in no case shall the\r\nMonthly Minimum Charge be less than $6.99; except that for three-phase service, the minimum\r\ncharge shall be $28.57 per month.\r\nIn determining the connected load, alternate, stand-by, or emergency equipment, that which\r\nconnected to the Company's service, replaces equipment of equal or greater connected load, shall not\r\nbe included.",
