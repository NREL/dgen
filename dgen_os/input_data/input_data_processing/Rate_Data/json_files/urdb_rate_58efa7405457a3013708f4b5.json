Where all dwelling units in a multi-occupancy building are served through one meter and the common use area is metered separately, the kilowatt-hour rate will be applied on a \"per residence\" or \"per apartment\" basis, however, the customer charge will be based on the number of installed meters.\r\nWhere a portion of a residential service is used for purposes of a commercial or public character, Rate DS, Service At Distribution Voltage, is applicable to all service. However, if the wiring is so arranged that the service for residential purposes can be metered separately, this Rate will be applied to the residential service, if the service qualifies hereunder.",
