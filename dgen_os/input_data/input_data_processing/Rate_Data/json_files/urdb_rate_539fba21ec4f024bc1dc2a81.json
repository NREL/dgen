Demand charges will be adjusted for average power factors lower than ninety-five percent (95%) when the District deems it necessary. Such adjustments will be made by increasing the measured demand two percent (2%) for each one percent (1%) by which the average power factor is less than 95% lagging. All motors of 10 H.P. or more must be equipped with properly sized capacitors.",
