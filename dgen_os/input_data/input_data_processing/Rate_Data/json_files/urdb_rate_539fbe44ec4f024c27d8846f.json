Service under this Schedule is not applicable for farm operations such as crop dryers or tobacco barns, or for other commercial purposes. However, where this type of service is in combination with residential service and the total demand of the nonresidential usage is not greater than the total demand of the residential service requirements, the consumer may be served under this Schedule. If the predominant demand is nonresidential in nature, the Member must be served under a General Service schedule or the residential and nonresidential loads will be metered separately and billed under the appropriate schedule for each service. Service shall be provided at one location through one meter.\n\nRENEWABLE ENERGY PORTFOLIO STANDARD (REPS) ADJUSTMENT\nResidential Service $ 0.83 / month (included in the Fixed monthly charge)",
