Demand charges may be adjusted for all consumers with one hundred (100) KW or more of billing demand to correct for peak power factors lower than ninety (90) percent.\n\n*WHOLESALE POWER COST ADJUSTMENT:\nThe above rate shall be increased or decreased subject to the provisions of the Cooperative's Wholesale Power Cost Adjustment schedule as set by the Cooperative's Board of Directors.",
